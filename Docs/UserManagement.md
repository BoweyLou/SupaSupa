# User Management Plan Checklist

This document now provides a checklist to track the implementation progress of the User Management features for the Rewards App.

## Overview
User management is essential for secure and role-based access control for both Parents and Children, integrating with Supabase for authentication, database storage, and secure API access.

## Checklist Steps

### Step 1: Registration & Authentication
- [x] Implement Supabase Auth for secure sign-up and login flows.
- [x] Develop Parent registration flow (using email and password) that automatically creates a Family record.
- [ ] Develop a process for Parents to add Child accounts to their Family.

### Step 2: User Roles & Flows
#### Parent Users:
- [ ] Enable Parent account management: create, update, and delete Child accounts.
- [ ] Ensure Parents have full administrative privileges and can manage task completions and settings.

#### Child Users:
- [ ] Create a simplified registration process for Child accounts (minimal details such as name only).
- [ ] Ensure Children have restricted access, limited to viewing tasks and marking them as complete.

### Step 3: Database Schema Setup
- [ ] Create the **Users Table** with the following fields:
  - user_id (Primary key)
  - family_id (Foreign key to Families)
  - name (User's display name)
  - email (Required for Parents; optionally nullable for Children)
  - role (Enum: 'parent' or 'child')
  - points (Default 0 for Child users)
  - created_at, updated_at (Timestamps)
- [x] Create the **Families Table** with the following fields:
  - family_id (Unique identifier)
  - family_name (Optional friendly name)
  - created_by (Reference to the Parent who created the Family)
  - created_at, updated_at (Timestamps)

### Step 4: Security & Best Practices
- [ ] Apply role-based access control to all API endpoints and UI components.
- [ ] Follow Supabase best practices for secure session management and user identity handling.
- [ ] Enforce robust password policies and implement multi-factor authentication for Parent accounts where applicable.

### Step 5: Tools & Implementation
- [x] Integrate Supabase for backend services including authentication and database management.
- [ ] Modularize user management logic to separate it from other core features.
- [ ] Regularly update documentation (README.md and CHANGELOG.md) with any enhancements or changes.

### Step 6: Future Enhancements
- [ ] Explore the use of social logins for Parents as an alternative registration option.
- [ ] Implement advanced security measures like multi-factor authentication.
- [ ] Consider more granular role definitions and permissions as the app scales.
- [ ] Enhance the Parent dashboard for improved management and monitoring of Child activities.

## Summary
This checklist outlines all the steps required to build and secure the User Management system in the Rewards App. Items marked with [x] are completed based on our code review.
