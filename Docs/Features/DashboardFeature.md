# Dashboard Feature Checklist

This document outlines the tasks and responsibilities required to implement the "Child Tasks" feature for the parent dashboard. Use the checklist below to track progress as each step is completed.

## Data Fetching & Aggregation
- [ ] Fetch family record and retrieve associated child accounts (role: "child") from the database.
- [ ] For each child account, query the tasks table to dynamically retrieve tasks using the child's unique ID.
- [ ] Use multiple queries.

## UI & Component Design
- [ ] Design and implement a reusable UI component (e.g., ChildDashboardSection) for displaying child tasks.
- [ ] Integrate the child tasks component into the parent's dashboard page.
- [ ] Ensure that child tasks are clearly differentiated from the parent's tasks.

## Interaction and Behavior
- [ ] Provide a summary view for each child account (e.g., task counts, brief task info).
- [ ] Implement expand/collapse functionality to view detailed tasks on demand.
- [ ] Allow task status updates per user roles (child tasks: "pending approval", parent tasks: "completed").

## Error Handling & Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement error handling and user feedback for failed queries or task updates, following best practices (e.g., /src/utils/errors.ts).
- [ ] Consider optimizing database queries to aggregate child tasks efficiently.
- [ ] Plan for future enhancements such as task approval/rejection by the parent.

## Documentation and Integration
- [ ] Update documentation (this file, DashboardLogic.md, and README.md) to reflect new feature details.
- [ ] Add an entry to the CHANGELOG.md with details about this new feature.
- [ ] Ensure the feature is covered by appropriate unit and integration tests.

## Next Steps in Development
- [ ] Phase 1: Modify the data layer to support dynamic fetching of child tasks.
- [ ] Phase 2: Build and test the new UI component for child tasks.
- [ ] Phase 3: Integrate the child tasks component into the parent dashboard page.
- [ ] Phase 4: Finalize documentation and update release notes.
