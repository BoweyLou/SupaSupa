// This documentation explains the star rating feature in the PointsDisplay component

## Overview
The PointsDisplay component has been updated to help kids understand their points more visually. In addition to displaying the numerical value, the component now shows a star rating:

- For every 10 points, a full star is displayed.
- If there is an additional 5 or more points that don't make up a full 10, a half star is shown.

This design leverages familiar visual metaphors (full and half stars) that assist young children in counting and recognizing intervals of points.

## How It Works
Inside the PointsDisplay component (located at `src/components/PointsDisplay.tsx`), a helper function `renderStars` has been added. Here's what this function does:

1. It calculates the number of full stars by dividing the points by 10 and taking the floor of the result.
2. It checks if the remaining points (after accounting for full stars) are at least 5. If yes, a half star is added.
3. The full and half stars are rendered using the `Star` icon from the `lucide-react` library. The half star effect is achieved using CSS's `clipPath` to show only half of the icon.

## Example
- If a child has 5 points: The component will show one half star.
- If a child has 10 points: The component will show one full star.
- If a child has 15 points: The component will show one full star and one half star.
- If a child has 20 points: The component will show two full stars.

## Why This Change?
This change was implemented to improve the user experience for younger users by providing a more intuitive visual representation of their progress. The star-based system makes it easier for children to grasp the concept of earning points and advancing in levels.

## Future Considerations
- Monitor user feedback to see if this visualization improves engagement and understanding.
- Adjust the thresholds if needed based on how users respond to the new system.
